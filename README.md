# Roger's note #
Hi The Warehouse Group team,

Thanks for the opportunity to make this project. I have created a simple Spring RESTful API and a micro frontend using ReactJS and Redux. I hope you like it.

This project is currently using H2 in memory database.

Please find the available request using the Swagger client provided: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

In case you have any questions, please fell free to contact me.

Thanks once again and I wish you the best of luck in finding the best fit for your team.

Kind regards,        
Roger Virtuoso
